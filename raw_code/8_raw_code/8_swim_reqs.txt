8) SWIM Airspeed

[] Model: ‘swim_12B.mdl’

Description: This example provides a safety algorithm for monitoring
airspeed in the SWIM (System Wide Integrity Monitor) suite in order to
provide warning to an operator when the vehicle speed is approaching a
boundary where an evasive flyup maneuver cannot be achieved.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

1.  The SWIM Airspeed algorithm shall output the minimum AGCAS airspeed
    required to perform a 2g flyup as follows:

  Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots) =

  SQRT{[2*Load Factor*Gross Weight]/[Air Density at sea level *

  Coefficient of Lift Max*Wing Area]} / 1.6891 (ft/s/knots)

  where

  Load Factor = 2 gs

  Gross weight of the aircraft

  Air Density at sea level = 0.0023769 slugs/ft^3

  Coefficient of Lift Max = 1.24 (CAT I) and 1.10 (CAT III)

  Wing Area of the F-16 = 300 ft^2

  Thus,

  IF CAT I, Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots) = 1.25921 * SQRT(Gross
  Weight) + 10.0

  IF CAT III, Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots) = 1.33694 * SQRT(Gross
  Weight) + 10.0

2.  When a low speed warning is allowed, as computed by the SWIM
    Airspeed algorithm, a low speed warning shall be true when the
    vehicle air data impact pressure is less than the warning trigger
    for minimum impact pressure in which a safe AGCAS evasive maneuver
    can be accomplished where:

  The warning trigger for minimum impact pressure in which a safe AGCAS
  evasive maneuver can be accomplished is computed as

  SWIM_Qcmin_lbspft2 = [(-2.0906 + 0.020306*Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas) +
  0.1] * (70.7184 (lbspft2/in Hg))
