1) Finite State Machine

Model: ‘fsm_12B.mdl’

[]Description: this model represents an abstraction of detailed design
requirements for an Advanced Autopilot System interacting with an
independent sensor platform. The Finite State Machine (FSM) represents a
cyber-physical system with two independent components executing in real
time for the purpose of ensuring a safe automatic operation in the
vicinity of hazardous obstacles. The autopilot system, tightly
integrated with the vehicle flight control computer, is responsible for
commanding a safety maneuver in the event of a hazard. The sensor is the
reporting agent to the autopilot with observability on imminent danger.
When the conditions are met to allow an autopilot operation (supported
and no failures) and the pilot is not manually controlling the vehicle
(standby is false), the autopilot will behave normally until a maneuver
is required in the event of a hazard (sensor is not good).
