based on the analysis generate a assertion based C code in ert_main.c, use esbmc to do verification 1. set global value for system or loop if needed 2. run system then verify it after each loop 3. set assertion based on requirements and use \_\_ESBMC\_assert (Search the use of \_\_ESBMC\_assert) to verify them and use the format of #ifdef VERIFY_PROPERTY_N for each requirement; Do not define the VERIFY_PROPERTY, it would be 4. set resonable loop number and while loop to run the system 5. write a reasonable while loop to run the system 6. DO NOT skip any requirement and use property to represent them 7. please check if the value really keep the previous state or not 8.use ```_Bool nondet_bool``` or similar format for nondet (dont add prefix) 9. please write all the property and put their run code in main function as well 10. bool use _Bool 11. make it could use preprocessing macros to control verification 12. Ensure the code is in correct format 13. do not use static to save prev loop information, just use variables
