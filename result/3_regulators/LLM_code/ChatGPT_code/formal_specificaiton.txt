Systematic Code-Based Analysis
==============================

Below is a detailed analysis derived strictly from the provided C code excerpts (`regs_12B.c`, `regs_12B_data.c`) and the specified requirements. All variable names and signal names exactly match their usage in the code. Each “global step” call (i.e., `regs_12B_step()`) is considered a single cycle at the nominal 100 Hz update rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) State Variable Mapping
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the generated code, the internal (persistent) state variables are all stored in the `DW` structure (`DW rtDW`). Their definitions and update sequences appear at the end of the `regs_12B_step()` function. **All updates occur after the global step.** Below is a list of each state variable, possible values, and usage meaning based solely on the code:

1. **`rtDW.Memory_PreviousInput`**  
   - **Type**: `real_T`  
   - **Range**: Not explicitly clamped; numeric range governed by double precision in C.  
   - **Meaning**: Stores the previous-cycle value of the local variable `rtb_Sum1` from Subsystem `<S9>`. Used in the summation logic associated with `hcvdt_cmd_fcs_fps2` calculations.

2. **`rtDW.UnitDelay_DSTATE`**  
   - **Type**: `real_T`  
   - **Range**: Not explicitly clamped; numeric range governed by double precision in C.  
   - **Meaning**: Used in Subsystem `<S13>` for the integral-like calculation of the height channel commands. At the end of each cycle, it is assigned `rtb_CVdt_cmd` (the difference of `hcv_cmd_fcs_fps` and `zcv_fcs_fps`, possibly saturated).

3. **`rtDW.UnitDelay1_DSTATE`**  
   - **Type**: `real_T`  
   - **Range**: Not explicitly clamped; numeric range governed by double precision in C.  
   - **Meaning**: Used in Subsystem `<S13>` for the integrator state in height channel. At the end of each cycle, it is assigned `rtb_Sum1` (the integrated sum for the height regulator).

4. **`rtDW.UnitDelay_DSTATE_o`**  
   - **Type**: `real_T`  
   - **Range**: Not explicitly clamped; numeric range governed by double precision in C.  
   - **Meaning**: Used in Subsystem `<S16>` for the pitch channel. At the end of each cycle, it is assigned `rtb_Sum3` (the difference of `mcv_cmd_fcs_dps` and `mcv_fcs_dps`).

5. **`rtDW.UnitDelay1_DSTATE_k`**  
   - **Type**: `real_T`  
   - **Range**: Not explicitly clamped; numeric range governed by double precision in C.  
   - **Meaning**: Used in Subsystem `<S16>` for the integrator state in the pitch channel. At the end of each cycle, it is assigned `rtb_Sum1_h` (the integrated sum for the pitch regulator).

**IMPORTANT**:  
All above states are updated only *after* `regs_12B_step()` finishes computing the new outputs. Then, in the next cycle, these new states are used as inputs to the next step’s calculations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Requirements Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are the ten requirements exactly as provided. For each requirement, we identify:

- **Relevant State Variables** (if any) needed to monitor or derive the relevant output.
- **Input Triggers** or conditions causing the output to change.
- **Expected State Changes** that correspond to the requirement’s behavior.
- **Output Verification** signals to be monitored or verified.
- **Timing Requirements** regarding how many cycles (at 100 Hz) are involved in each check.

Each requirement stands alone with no merging.

--------------------------------------------------
(1) The Inner Loop Roll Regulator Shall not command angular roll accelerations greater than the capability of the system (50 deg/sec2) for durations exceeding 100 frames (1 second @ 100 hz).

- **Relevant State Variables**:  
  None directly control the roll acceleration in this code; the roll acceleration command is computed in one line.  
  The roll acceleration command is `rtY.lcvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2`.

- **Input Triggers**:  
  - `rtU.lcv_cmd_fcs_dps`  
  - `rtU.lcv_fps_dps`  

- **Expected State Changes**:  
  - No code-based internal “if” or clamp specifically for 50 deg/sec2. The code sets `rtY.lcvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2 = (rtU.lcv_cmd_fcs_dps - rtU.lcv_fps_dps) * 2.5;`.  
  - The persistent states (`Memory_PreviousInput`, `UnitDelay_*`) do not affect `lcvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2`.

- **Output Verification**:  
  - Check `rtY.lcvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2` each cycle to ensure it does not exceed 50 deg/sec2 for longer than 100 consecutive cycles.

- **Timing Requirements**:  
  - Must monitor over 100 frames (1 second).

  - `rtU.ncv_fcs_dps`  
  - `rtU.beta_adc_deg`, `rtU.beta_dot`, and `rtU.vtas_adc_kts` (used in the yaw logic `<S12>`)

- **Expected State Changes**:  
  - `rtY.ncvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2` is computed via multi-term expression:  
    ```
    rtY.ncvdt_cmd_fcs_dps2 =
       ((ncv_cmd_fcs_dps * 4.0 + 4.0 * beta_adc_deg) + 1.5 * beta_dot) * <transition> 
       + (1.0 - <transition>) * (ncv_cmd_fcs_dps - ncv_fcs_dps);
    ```
  - No direct clamp is present for 50 deg/sec2.

3) Timing Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update Sequences**  
- Each call to `regs_12B_step()` constitutes one cycle.

- **Very Important**: The five persistent states (`Memory_PreviousInput`, `UnitDelay_DSTATE`, `UnitDelay1_DSTATE`, `UnitDelay_DSTATE_o`, `UnitDelay1_DSTATE_k`) are all updated *after* the outputs are calculated at the very end of `regs_12B_step()`. Specifically:
