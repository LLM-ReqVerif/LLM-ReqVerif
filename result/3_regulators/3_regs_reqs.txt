3) Regulators
Model:  ‘regs_12B.mdl’
Description:  This example model demonstrates a simplified regulators inner loop architecture used in many feedback control applications.  The model includes two subsystems.  The first is the input subsystem which is used solely for signal routing with variable renaming and bus creation.  The second subsystem is the primary system under test, the regulators algorithm.  The regulators algorithm consists of 5 classical controllers for establishing the desired dynamics of a vehicle for the roll, pitch, yaw, axial, and height channels.
