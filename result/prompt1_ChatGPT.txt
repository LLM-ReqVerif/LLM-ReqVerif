Please:
1. Extract from the code:
   - Key state variables and their meanings 
   - State transitions and conditions
   - Update sequences
2. For each requirement, automatically identify:
   - Relevant state variables
   - Trigger conditions
   - Expected state transitions
   - Required verification timing (in cycles)
Output format:
1. State Variable Mapping
   - Variable names
   - Possible values
   - Meanings
2. For each requirement:
   - Initial conditions
   - Input triggers
   - Expected state changes
   - Output verification
   - Timing requirements
3. Timing Considerations
   - Update sequences
   - Critical dependencies
   - Cycle requirements
Notes:
- Each global step call represents one cycle
- All state checks should be performed at cycle end
- Focus on actual code implementation details
- Check point for each time step is after the global step call
- generate for all the requirements with no general and do not summary multiply requirements in one property
- and need to keep with the same number label
Please provide a systematic analysis based purely on the provided code and requirements.
- CLEARLY label if the UnitDelay is updated after  global_step() with what value VERY IMPORTANT!!
- All input output or state need to be same with the representation way in code
- Must Restrictly follow the name definition or attribute definition in the C file and pay attention to System External name
