1) STATE VARIABLE MAPPING
-------------------------
According to the provided C code (`nn_12B.c` and `nn_12B_data.c`), there are NO persistent/discrete state variables that carry values across calls to `nn_12B_step()`. There is no structure like `rtDW` or any `UnitDelay` usage, and no variables are retained from one execution cycle to the next. The code is purely a feed-forward neural network calculation. All intermediate arrays (`rtb_Sum[]`, `rtb_Merge_0[]`, `rtb_Product2_0[]`) are local to each step call and do not persist after the function returns.

Hence, there are NO true "internal states" that get updated each cycle.  
**IMPORTANT**: There is NO UnitDelay in this code. Therefore, there is no update after `nn_12B_step()` for any persistent variable.

**External / Global Variables**  
- `ExternalInputs rtU`:  
  - `rtU.x` (Double) — First Input Signal  
  - `rtU.y` (Double) — Second Input Signal  

- `ExternalOutputs rtY`:  
  - `rtY.z` (Double) — Dependent Variable Output Signal  

**Local/Temporary Variables** (within `nn_12B_step()` only, recalculated each cycle):  
- `rtb_Sum[10]`, `rtb_Merge_0[10]`, `rtb_Product2_0[10]`, `tmp`, `tmp_0`, `i`, `i_0`.  

These local variables exist only during the function call of `nn_12B_step()` and are destroyed once the function returns.  

Since there are no persistent states, there are no enumerated values or transitions for them. They simply hold intermediate calculations for each single call (cycle).

2) REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
-------------------------
Below, each requirement from the specification is addressed **separately**.  
For each requirement, we identify:
- Relevant variables in the code  
- Conditions or triggers in the code (if any)  
- Expected changes of states or outputs (if any)  
- Required verification timing (in cycles)  

As there are no internal states or discrete updates in `nn_12B_step()`, the “state transitions” concept is effectively **not applicable** to any internal feedback or memory. Verification must thus be performed at the end of each cycle, by checking the final output `rtY.z` against the requirement.  

----------
Requirement 1
----------
**Text**: "The maximum value of the NN output, `z`, shall always be less than or equal to 1.1, regardless of the input values."

- **Relevant State Variables**:  
  None (no persistent states).  
  - **Relevant Code Variables**:  
    - Input: `rtU.x`, `rtU.y`  
    - Output: `rtY.z`  

- **Trigger Conditions**:  
  - Each execution of `nn_12B_step()` uses `rtU.x` and `rtU.y` as inputs and generates `rtY.z`.  
  - This requirement implies we check `rtY.z` at the end of each cycle.

- **Expected State Transitions**:  
  - Not applicable (no stored states). The code does a direct feed-forward calculation.

- **Output Verification**:  
  - After `nn_12B_step()` finishes, verify:  
    ```
    if (rtY.z <= 1.1)  // requirement satisfied
    else              // requirement violated
    ```
  - This check is done every cycle, at the end of `nn_12B_step()`.

- **Timing Requirements** (in cycles):  
  - Perform the check immediately after each `nn_12B_step()` call (i.e. once per cycle).

----------
Requirement 2
----------
**Text**: "The minimum value of the NN output, `z`, shall always be greater than or equal to -0.2, regardless of the input values."

- **Relevant State Variables**:  
  None (no persistent states).
  - **Relevant Code Variables**:  
    - Input: `rtU.x`, `rtU.y`
    - Output: `rtY.z`

- **Trigger Conditions**:  
  - Each call to `nn_12B_step()`.

- **Expected State Transitions**:  
  - Not applicable. The code simply computes one feed-forward output each cycle.

- **Output Verification**:  
  - After `nn_12B_step()` finishes, verify:
    ```
    if (rtY.z >= -0.2)  // requirement satisfied
    else               // requirement violated
    ```
  - Again, one check per cycle at the end of `nn_12B_step()`.

- **Timing Requirements**:  
  - Verify once per cycle, after `nn_12B_step()`.

----------
Requirement 3
----------
**Text**: "Using a first-order finite backward difference equation, the spatial derivatives of Δz/Δxt and Δz/Δyt shall never exceed +10 or be below -35, i.e. -35 <= Δz/Δ(xt, yt) <= +10 for consecutive indices in the included truth data."

- **Relevant State Variables**:  
  None in code. There is no code-based memory to store previous `rtY.z` or `rtU.x` or `rtU.y`.  

  However, the requirement implies comparing consecutive data points `(xt(n), z(n))` vs `(xt(n-1), z(n-1))`. This is not directly implemented in `nn_12B.c`. The code does not keep a "previous" value from cycle to cycle.  

- **Trigger Conditions**:  
  - Potentially each new input `(rtU.x, rtU.y)` that arrives in consecutive cycles.
  - The code itself does not measure or store these derivatives; it simply computes `rtY.z` at each cycle.

- **Expected State Transitions**:  
  - Not applicable. No updates or memory of previous values in the code.

- **Output Verification**:  
  - Must be done externally. After each cycle, the external harness/test must compare the new `(x, z)` with the previously stored `(x_prev, z_prev)`.  
  - Then compute:
    \[
      \Delta z / \Delta x = (z(n) - z(n-1)) / (x(n) - x(n-1)),
      \quad
      \Delta z / \Delta y = (z(n) - z(n-1)) / (y(n) - y(n-1))
    \]
    Verify that each partial derivative stays within \([-35, +10]\).

- **Timing Requirements**:  
  - Since the code does not store previous steps, an external test harness must store the previous cycle’s `x, y, z` and compare at the **end** of the new cycle.  
  - This occurs once per cycle after `nn_12B_step()` completes.  
  - **No internal code update** (because no persistent memory is in the code).

----------
Requirement 4
----------
**Text**: "The absolute error between the zt truth data and the output z shall never exceed a tolerance of 0.01 for the equivalent input of (xt, yt)."

- **Relevant State Variables**:  
  None (no persistent states).

- **Trigger Conditions**:  
  - Each call to `nn_12B_step()` with a known ground-truth value `zt` for `(rtU.x, rtU.y)`.

- **Expected State Transitions**:  
  - Not applicable. The code only computes an immediate feed-forward output.

- **Output Verification**:  
  - Externally compare the code’s output `rtY.z` with the truth data `zt`.  
  - Check:
    ```
    if (fabs(rtY.z - zt) <= 0.01)  // requirement satisfied
    else                          // requirement violated
    ```
  - Done once per cycle, after the function call.

- **Timing Requirements**:  
  - One check per cycle after `nn_12B_step()`, for each test input `(x, y, zt)`.

3) TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------
- **Update Sequences**:  
  In `nn_12B_step()`, the code calculates `rtY.z` from `rtU.x` and `rtU.y` with a purely feed-forward approach. No memory or state is updated. Hence, there is no concept of “internal state progression” across cycles in this implementation.

- **Critical Dependencies**:  
  All checks (Requirements #1, #2, #3, #4) rely on the final value `rtY.z` from the end of each call to `nn_12B_step()` and possibly the input or output from the previous cycle (requirement #3). Since the code does not store the previous cycle’s data, an external mechanism must track previous `(x, y, z)` for derivative checks.

- **Cycle Requirements**:  
  Each call to `nn_12B_step()` is one cycle. Verification should be done after the function returns in every cycle.

----------------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON “UnitDelay” OR “DW”:
----------------------------------------------
**There is NO “UnitDelay” usage or `rtDW` structure** in this code. Therefore, there is no variable that gets updated at the end of `nn_12B_step()`. All local arrays and variables are temporary and destroyed once the function returns. No persistent or feedback states exist in this implementation.
