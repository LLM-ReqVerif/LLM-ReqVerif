# LLM-ReqVerif: LLM-Assisted Formal Verification for Requirements

## üìå Overview
LLM-ReqVerif is a framework for translating **natural language requirements** into **verifiable properties** and integrating them with **formal verification tools**. The project provides:
- **C code-based verification properties** extracted from Simulink models.
- **Automated verification scripts** using SLDV, CoCoSim, Claude+ESBMC, and ChatGPT+ESBMC.
- **A ground truth comparison framework** to evaluate different verification methods.

This repository includes all necessary resources to **run, test, and validate** formal verification using **LLMs and traditional tools**.

### üîπ **Key Components**
- **`include/`**: Contains required Simulink C header files for proper compilation.
- **`raw_code/`**: The main C code extracted from Simulink, forming the basis of all verification.
- **`result/`**: Verification results from various tools, including scripts for evaluating correctness.
- **`run_verification`**: A script that automatically evaluates results based on the ground truth from SLDV and CoCoSim.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1 **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeW1999/LLM-ReqVerif.git
cd LLM-ReqVerif
```

### 2 Run Full Verification
result has been collected at /result/verification_summary.csv
```
class PropertyVerifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.include_paths = [
            "./",
            "/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/simulink/include",
            "/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/rtw/c/src",
            "/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/extern/include",
            "/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/simulink/include/sf_runtime"
        ]
```

should be changed with your own path.
then 
```
cd result
python run_verification.py
```



### 3 Run a Specific Verification Property
To verify a specific property (e.g., VERIFY_PROPERTY_1), use:
```
cd 1_fsm/LLM_code/Claude_code
esbmc ert_main.c triplex_12B.c -I ./ -I ../../../ --k-induction --memlimit 8g --timeout 300 -DVERIFY_PROPERTY_1
```

‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
This framework relies on the following formal verification tools:

ESBMC ‚Äì C Model Checker https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc

CoCoSim ‚Äì MATLAB/Simulink Verification Tool (could not install)

SLDV (Simulink Design Verifier) ‚Äì MATLAB built-in verification tool

‚úÖ Adapting to Other Formal Verification Tools

This framework can be adapted to other tools like CBMC, Kind2, CPAChecker, etc.

To do so, modify:
```c
__ESBMC_assert(bool, "")
```
to:

```c
assert(bool)
```
for compatibility with other verification tools.
